# Tailwind CSS Laravel Mix (PostCSS) Starter Project

We use this as a starter template to quickly develop static HTML pages with :
- TailwindCSS 2.1
- Laravel Mix 6 (Webpack)
- PostCSS
- PostCSS Nested
- PostCSS Import

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that, start up Laravel Mix:

```
npm run dev
# to watch changes
npm run watch
```

Base Tailwind CSS file is under `/resources/assets/css/styles.css`  
Root HTML file is under `/public/index.html` 

To build a production bundle run:

```
npm run prod
```

After that you will have a ready to deploy at `/public`
